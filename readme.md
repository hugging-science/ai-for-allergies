# AI for Food Allergies

## Why

Food allergy is a medical condition affecting **over 220 million people worldwide**, and the number keeps rising.  
Living with a food allergy impacts both **physical and mental health** â€” from the constant fear of accidental exposure to the daily burden of carrying epinephrine and cortisone everywhere.

Beyond the risk of **life-threatening reactions** like anaphylaxis, thereâ€™s also the social isolation and anxiety that come with always having to be careful about what you eat.

*Can we do something about it?*

## The First Step: Building the Dataset Base

Before anything else, we need **data**.  
That means identifying, collecting, and curating **relevant datasets** â€” from clinical records and immunotherapy trials to genomics, proteomics, and microbiome data.

This phase involves:
- Mapping existing data sources  
- Handling missing and heterogeneous data  
- Ensuring privacy compliance  
- Collaborating with research labs  

Weâ€™re building the **first open, structured repository** of datasets related to food allergy research.


Thanks to all our explorers whoâ€™ve contributed so far ðŸ¤

## ðŸŒ± Our Goal

To explore and advance the application of **AI to Food Allergy research** â€” by:
- Identifying **open problems**
- Building **resources**
- Enabling **collaboration**
- Doing **something genuinely useful**

This field is wide open â€” and together, we can help push it forward.

> *A final remark*  
> If you donâ€™t suffer from food allergies, you likely know someone who does.  
> This is a daily challenge for millions â€” but also a space full of opportunity for meaningful research.  
>  
> Letâ€™s build, learn, and contribute â€” while having fun along the way. ðŸ’¡
