## Awesome food allergy datasets

Our goal with this project is to create the first comprehensive collection of Food Allergy related datasets, with great potential for both ML enthusiasts, and the scientific community in general.

We identified three main tracks to explore and find datasets about:

**🏥 Early detection & Diagnosis**

AI models analyze diverse patient data including genomics, electronic health records, IgE levels, and family history to predict an individual's risk of developing a food allergy. Machine learning algorithms identify complex patterns across these datasets that are not apparent to human clinicians, enabling earlier and more accurate risk assessment.

**🧬 Drug Design**

AI used to accelerate the development of safer immunotherapies. Models analyze the 3D structure of allergenic proteins to identify specific regions (epitopes) that trigger the allergic reaction. This allows scientists to computationally redesign these proteins, modifying the allergenic parts while preserving the segments needed to build immune tolerance.

**🌿 Food engineering**

Create hypoallergenic foods by engineering the expression of certain epitopes. A nice starting example for this is [AgroNT, a large language foundational model for edible plant genomes](https://instadeep.com/research/paper/a-large-language-foundational-model-for-edible-plant-genomes/) by Instadeep.
